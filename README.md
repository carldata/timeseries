# Welcome to the Time Series library

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/carldata/timeseries.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/carldata/timeseries)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.carldata/timeseries_2.12/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.carldata/timeseries_2.12)

Library for processing Time Series.


## Quick start
 
 Add the following dependency to the build.sbt
 ```scala
 libraryDependencies += "io.github.carldata" %% "timeseries" % "0.6.9"
 ```

Running benchmarks
```bash
sbt -mem 4000 run
```
